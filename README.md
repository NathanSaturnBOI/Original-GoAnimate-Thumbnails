# The Original GoAnimate Thumbnails
This repository is a storage location for stock-theme thumbnails originated from the s3.amazonaws.com/fs.goanimate.com database site and from the original GoAnimate/Vyond site. Unfortunate the fact that the thumbnails and stuff from that site are no longer existent as of 2022, meaning at least few of the thumbnail ids were assumed at least the closest they can be. Thumbnails that were missing or weren't saved before were either found or recreated are being added onto the archive as time goes depending on the ids for each thumbnail.

Credit goes to VisualPlugin for the original repository.
